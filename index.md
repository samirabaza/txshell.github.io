### 3. How to assemble
There are 3 simple steps to assemble the shell.

Keep in mind the following 2 simple rules during the assembly:
   - for each plate, always ensure its side with carves facing the developer kit
   - alway place a washer between the kit/a driver and a cylinder

In the end, it should looks like:

 placing a `m3 washer` between them and use `m3 screws` to secure the driver,
 then you done.
